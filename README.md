# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, everyone. i am Anish. i am interested in coding and other techy stuff. i am mostly into python and java. Even though i am 13 years old, i would like to learn and code everyday!!! i usually use visual studio code to develop various codes and stuff along those lines, but i first coded in pycharm which was not that complicated as visual studio code!
